## 📊 Overview  

Cableguys ShaperBox is a comprehensive multi-effects environment designed for producers who want deep control over rhythm, movement, width, volume, distortion, and timing. Built around Cableguys’ signature curve-based modulation engine, ShaperBox allows users to draw custom LFO shapes, trigger precise envelopes, and combine modular Shapers to transform sound in entirely new ways.

Its flexible architecture is ideal for electronic music, sound design, mixing, and creative editing. Each Shaper—such as Time, Volume, Filter, Pan, Width, Crush, Liquid, and others—functions as an independent module that can be layered, reordered, and synced with sample-accurate timing. With visual editing tools and intuitive drag-based workflows, users can reshape audio with detailed precision or automate rhythmic transformations effortlessly.

ShaperBox excels at sidechain-style ducking, tape-style time manipulation, stereo sculpting, animated filtering, transient-driven effects, and dynamic distortion. Producers can combine multiple Shapers to build evolving textures, modular rhythmic sequences, stutter edits, granular-like motion, or subtle enhancement effects. Every curve can be triggered by audio, MIDI, or synced LFOs, making the system extremely adaptive in any production style.

The suite integrates real-time visualization so users can see exactly how the effect is interacting with their audio. With its unified interface and powerful modulation tools, ShaperBox serves as a production toolbox that replaces numerous traditional plugins while offering far more flexibility and creative headroom.

Whether you’re sculpting drums, energizing synths, adding movement to pads, or experimenting with sound design, ShaperBox delivers a modern, dynamic workflow for shaping audio with precision and artistry.
